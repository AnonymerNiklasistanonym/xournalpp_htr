# Xournal++ HTR

Developing [handwritten text recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting_recognition) for [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp).

*Your contributions are greatly appreciated!*

TODO: Make this documentation the central part and adapt README for example like [here](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik). Replicate sections of current README here therefore.

## Why handwritten text recognition for Xournal++?

When moving from physical to digital note taking, one great benefit is searchability. Hence, when starting to use
digital handwritten notes, those should be searchable as well as to not compromise on the benefits of digital note
taking. This feature is called [handwritten text recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting_recognition).

The handwritten text recognition feature has been part of many commercial note taking apps for ages.

However, there exists no such handwritten text recognition feature for any open source handwriting application.

Hence, the goal of Xournal++ HTR is to bring handwritten text recognition to [Xournal++](https://xournalpp.github.io/),
which is one of the most popular open-source applications to take digital handwritten notes.

### TODO: add the following former section "Project description" to this section here

Taking handwritten notes digitally comes with many benefits but lacks searchability of your notes. Hence, there is a need to make your handwritten notes searchable. This can be achieved with ["handwritten text recognition" (HTR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting_recognition), which is the process of assigning searchable text to written strokes.

While many commercial note taking apps feature great HTR systems to make your notes searchable and there are a number of existing open-source implementations of various algorithms, there is no HTR feature available in an open-source note taking application that is privacy aware and processes your data locally.

    <p><b>The purpose of the <i>Xournal++ HTR</i> project is to change that!</b></p>
</div>

Xournal++ HTR strives to bring open-source on-device handwriting recognition to [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp) as it is one of the most adopted open-source note taking apps and thereby HTR can be delivered to the largest possible amount of users.
